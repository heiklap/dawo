From:  https://www.dartlang.org/tools/pub/package-layout:

Public tools.  NOT TOOL-FOLDER.
Dart scripts placed inside of the bin directory are public.
Any package that depends on your package can run scripts from your
package’s bin directory using pub run.
Any package can run scripts from your package’s bin directory using pub global.


If you intend for your package to be depended on, and you want your scripts
to be private to your package, place them in the top-level tool directory.
If you do not intend for your package to be depended on, you can leave your
scripts in bin.


Internal tools and scripts
enchilada/
  tool/
    generate_docs.dart
Mature packages often have little helper scripts and programs that people run
while developing the package itself. Think things like test runners, documentation
generators, or other bits of automation.

Unlike the scripts in bin, these are not for external users of the package.
If you have any of these, place them in a directory called tool.
