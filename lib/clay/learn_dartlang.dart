    'Object':
        'Everything you can place in a variable is an object, and every object is an instance of a class.',
    'Functions':
        'Functions can be assigned to variables or passed as arguments to other functions. ',

    'Libraries':
        ' Libraries can be distributed using packages, provide APIs, and are a unit of privacy.',
    'Scope':
        'Dart is a lexically scoped language, which means that the scope of variables is determined statically, simply by the layout of the code.',

    'Operators':

    'Control flow':
        'You can control the flow of your Dart code using any of the following: if and else, for loops, while and do-while loops, break and continue, switch and case, assert',
    'Generics':
        'The <â€¦> notation marks List as a generic (or parameterized) type. Types (generic or not) let you document and annotate your code, making your intent clearer.',
    'Asynchrony':
        'asynchronous: return after setting up a possibly time-consuming operation (such as I/O), without waiting for that operation to complete.',
    'Typedefs':
        'A typedef, or function-type alias, gives a function type a name that you can use when declaring fields and return types.',
