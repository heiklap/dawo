Development of dawo package 2017

_____________________________________________________________________________
Way to version 0.0.2, possible fixes:

1. DONE:  Little roll / render example
2. DONE   Readme file modified
3. DONE   Class constructors to every class

4. __e_   Import / export usage unclear. Get all files in one command.
          - is analyzer acting weird? do not show variables (fast enough)

5. __b_   Make Stream-play / explore file.  ( BOORING! )
6. DONE   Base structure class that important classes extend
          - includes: - INIT-BUILD-ROLL-SHOW-DONE syckle

7. DONE  StringBuffers to every important class and file for output.
          - this also adds visibility for variable-name

8. _h__  Start: Connector-class; Connect App-Mission-Chore classes functionality in mill-process
         - this is fine-graded and long development plan. ( DIFFICULT :( )

9. ____ Team notes (List and maps) maybe: in clay_in folder

10. DONE Add generic lists for every meaningful member
    * add usage later
